# Imaginary Hoover

To clone this repository type `git clone https://github.com/edfranco/hoover.git` in your terminal while in the directory of your choosing. There are no additional dependencies.

For this program you need to have the `server.js` file and `input.txt` file. You will want to make sure your `input.txt` file is in the same folder as your `server.js` file. The program works knowing the first two lines in your `input.txt` file are the grid paramaters and hoover starting coordinates respectively and that the last line is the movement instructions. It also knows anything in between line 2 and the last line are dirt coordinates so go ahead and edit/test at your leisure.

While in the same project directory run the `node server.js` commmand in your terminal to run the program and see the output.
