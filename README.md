# Imaginary Hoover

To run this program you will want to run `git clone https://github.com/edfranco/hoover.git`

You will want to make sure your `input.txt` file is in the same folder as your `server.js` file.

While in the same project directory run the `node server.js` commmand in your terminal to run the program and see the output.
