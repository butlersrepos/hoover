# Butler Hoover

```
git clone https://github.com/butlersrepos/hoover.git
cd hoover
node index.js
```

For this program you will use the `index.js` file and `input.txt` file. 
You will want to make sure your `input.txt` file is in the same folder as the `index.js` file. The program works expecting the first two lines in your `input.txt` file are the grid parameters and hoover starting coordinates respectively and that the last line is the movement instructions. It also knows anything in between line 2 and the last line are dirt coordinates so go ahead and edit/test at your leisure.

While in the same project directory run the `node index.js` command in your terminal to run the program and see the output.
